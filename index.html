          Nightmare on elm street is based off of a true story where a bunch of los angeles articles talked about a cambodian family coming to america to espace genocide. thats when one of the children feared if he went to sleep something would kill him. He stayed awake more multiple days and then died in the middle of a nightmare. after that, there was a lot of reports of similar deaths by people from cambodia.. unexplained.
