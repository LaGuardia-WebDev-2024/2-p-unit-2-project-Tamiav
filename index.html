      <p>
        American supernatural slasher film.The film's plot concerns a group of teenagers who are targeted by Krueger, an undead child killer who can murder people through their dreams, as retribution against their parents who burned him alive.
        <p>
          Nightmare on elm street is based off of a true story where a bunch of los angeles articles talked about a cambodian family coming to america to espace genocide. thats when one of the children feared if he went to sleep something would kill him. He stayed awake more multiple days and then died in the middle of a nightmare. after that, there was a lot of reports of similar deaths by people from cambodia.. unexplained.
